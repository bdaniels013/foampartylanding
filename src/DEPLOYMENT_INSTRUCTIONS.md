## Important Configuration Notes

### 1. Environment Variables
Currently, the site uses no external APIs, but if you add analytics or other services:
```bash
# Create .env file
VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_ga_id
VITE_FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id
```

### 2. Form Handling
The booking form currently simulates submission. To make it functional:

**Option A: Use Netlify Forms (if hosting on Netlify):**
```jsx
// Add to form tag in BookingForm.tsx
<form name="foam-party-booking" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
```

**Option B: Use Formspree:**
```jsx
// Update form action
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

**Option C: Custom Backend:**
- Set up a backend service (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Update the form submission handler
- Add proper email notifications

### 3. Analytics Integration
Add Google Analytics to track conversions:

```jsx
// Add to index.html head section
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

### 4. SEO Optimization
Update the `index.html` file with proper meta tags:

```html
<title>Gulf Coast Foam Party - Epic Birthday Parties in Mississippi</title>
<meta name="description" content="Transform your child's birthday into an unforgettable foam party! Serving Biloxi, Gulfport & Mississippi Gulf Coast. Book today for FREE Color/Glow foam upgrade!">
<meta name="keywords" content="foam party, birthday party, Mississippi, Gulf Coast, kids party, Biloxi, Gulfport">

<meta property="og:image" content="/og-image.jpg">
```
